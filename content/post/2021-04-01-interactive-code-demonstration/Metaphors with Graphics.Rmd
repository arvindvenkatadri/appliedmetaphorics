# What are we going to do
We will:

--

1.  First examine data and geometric graphics from a metaphoric standpoint.

--

2.  Develop graphics using a bunch of "graphical metaphors"

--

3.  Try to do that in something resembling **English gRammaR** ( well, nearly, it is code after all !!)

---
# And Why R we doing this, again?

--

### We are deeply interested in the making and analysis of metaphors

--

### This will help us appreciate **TRIZ** when we get there!


---

# How R we going to do it?
---

- Metaphors take information from a *source* **DOMAIN**. 

- And portray it in the *language* of the *target* Domain

---

- In R, we will take data from diverse **source Domains**

  - Ecology
  - Finance
  - Jewellery ( yeah!)
  - Weather
  - Star Wars
  - ...

--

- And make metaphors out of them

---

- Only our **target Domain** will be...Geometry. Hence, **R**

--

- Did I say: "To R is human"....

## How does one read Shakespeare? 
---

Well, you learn 
- the alphabet and then words, vocab; 

- **and then** sentences, paras, idioms, figure of speech; 

- **and then** poetry along with cadence, prosody, and metre; 

- **and then** drama and Greek Choruses.....

--

- And then you read Shakespeare. Simple.

---

NO.

--

You read Shakespeare directly, and reach for a dictionary when needed. 

And you get better at it as you go. 

--

We will do that also with ~~ShakespeaRe~~ R.

---

In the following, there are ready-made Shakespearean pieces of R code. 


(Oh, all right, all right, all right. )

--

~~To code or not to code, that is the question...~~

--

There's not to reason why, there's but to code and ~~die~~ fly!!

# PRIMM Process

---


- **PREDICT** what the code does, write predictions. Work In pairs
--


> *I think Hamlet was gay*

---

- **RUN** the code provided and see what it does. Check against your prediction

--
> *I am going to say "forsooth" in my Reflections*

---

- **INVESTIGATE** What the **code parameters** do ?

> Write **comments** to explain

> There are lots of different activities you can do at this stage: 
> - trace through the code, 
- comment the code, 
- answer questions about it, 
- label particular concepts, highlight it, 
- draw the flow of control, etc.  


--

> \# Hamlet is not Gay.  

> \# (Also, Arvind is not Cool. Sorry. )

> \# This R shape thingy makes everything into small squares...

---

- **MODIFY** the code parameters provided to understand the options available. 

--

> Sword = "pink" ? 

> Size = Uneasy_Crown?

---

- **MAKE** : take an idea/concept/data of your own, and graph it. 

--

> ( My next Insta will be an Outrageous Sling of Fortune...). 



---

- **Predict**: What could happen?

- **Run**: the code and see

- **Investigate**: What could really be happening?

- **Modify**: Mess with the code and try

- **Make**: Some thing brand new for yourself

# Editing your Markdown
---

1. Everything is text

2. Single stars make *italic* text

3. Double stars **bold** text

4. Three stars make  ***both bold and italic*** text

5. Double tildes make ~~deleted text~~

6. Hashes(`##`) become new Section Titles in text


---

1. Ctrl+Alt+I / CMD+Alt+I give code "chunks" which will "run".

2. Hashes(`#`) inside code chunks give you new #comments in code

3. "$mathstuff$" becomes $math$ like this (Nooo...please! No!)
  - $sin^2(x)+cos^2(x) = 1$ (I think)
4. emo::ji("laugh") becomes `r emo::ji("laugh")`


--

All this done with `plain text`. Just your keyboard and you. 

Mouses and Touchpads are for....**(your favourite word of ridicule here)**.

# What the Heck is a Grammar of Graphics?

Google defines a **grammar** as 
> "the whole system and structure of a language or of languages in general, usually taken as consisting of *syntax* and *morphology* (including inflections) and sometimes also *phonology* and *semantics*".

> [^2] Others consider a grammar to be "the fundamental principles or rules of an art or science".[^3].


Think of **R** as a way of using **GEOMETRY** as the *target domain* to describe information/ideas/concepts from *any* **source domain**.(Lakoff and Johnson).[^4]

Applied to visualizations, a **grammar of graphics** is a grammar used to describe and create a wide range of statistical graphics.[^5].

And we will use that grammar to allude geometrically to other source domain things.

---

# And `Layers`?

All graphics in **R** are built like a sandwich to create the final graphic.

Each slice is a fresh set of graphs/geometric objects on the visual. ( But what about lettuce, and cheese and mint-mayo...)

The **layered** grammar of graphics approach is implemented in an R-package called [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), a widely used graphics library for R.

## PAUSE #1


Are there any silent tears? 

---

## Let the R-ring begin


---

## Components of the layered grammar of graphics

### Layer

**Layers** are used to create the objects on a plot. They are defined by five basic parts:

--

1.  Data ( What dataset/spreadsheet am I using?)

--

2.  Mapping ( What does each column do in my graph?)

--

3.  Statistical transformation (stat) (Do I have calculate something first?)

--

4.  Geometric object (geom) ( What shape, colour, size..do I want?)

--

5.  Position adjustment (position) ( Where do I want it on the graph?)

---

# Tidy Data
![Tidy data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/allisonhorst/stats-illustrations/master/rstats-artwork/tidydata_1.jpg)

---

# Kinds of Variable

Variables in the dataset are defined by the kind of questions they answer to:

--
1.  What / Who / Where? -> Some kind of Name or Category (Remember Lars Gustaffson)

    - Map on to ( i.e.Plot with)  shape / colour/ size
--

2.  What Kind? How? -> Some kind "Type"

    - Map on to shape/ colour/ size
--

3.  How Many? How large? -> Some kind of Quantity

    - Map on to points / lines / bars / ....

---

# Data and mapping

We can map variables metaphorically to *geometric* things in R: 

- shape, colour, size, alpha(how dark?)....

we will now use "real world" data. Let's use the `penguins` dataset in the `palmerpenguins` package.,sub[^6]</sub>

[^6]: Run `?penguins` in the console to get more information about this dataset.

```{r penguins,highlight.output = c(4,5,6)}
head(penguins, n = 3)
```



---
**Aesthetic Mapping** defines how the variables are applied to the plot. So if we were graphing information from `penguins`, we might map a penguin's flipper_length_mm to the $x$ position and body_mass_g to the $y$ position.
We can map variables metaphorically to other things: shape, colour, size, alpha(how dark?)....
